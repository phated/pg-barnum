"There's a sucker born every minute"

## Wishlist

* Only PostgresSQL support (supporting other libraries generates worse code)
* Integrate Factories, Fixtures and Migrations into 1 library
* Lifecycle hooks (before, after, etc)
* Plain JS objects where possible (no classes/constructors)
* Template support (lodash templates?)
* __Very__ good relation support
* Generator (based off a template schema?)
* Transaction support (if possible)
* Good PostGIS support
